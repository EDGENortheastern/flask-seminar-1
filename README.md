### Virtual environment

The very first step to Flask is the usual one.
Make a repo, clone, navigate into, open in VSCode.

Then it is a good idea to have a virtual environment for your Python. Make sure to check the Python version first.

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Activate the environment.

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install flask
```
